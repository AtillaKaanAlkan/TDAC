# TDAC: a Time-Domain Astrophysics Corpus
TDAC is the first time-domain astrophysics corpus based on astronomical observation reports (GCN Circulars, ATel Telegrams and AstroNotes).

    abstract = "The increased interest in time-domain astronomy over the last decades has resulted in a substantial increase in observation reports publication leading to a saturation of how astrophysicists read, analyze and classify information. Due to the short life span of the detected astronomical events, the information related to the characterization of new phenomena has to be communicated and analyzed very rapidly to allow other observatories to react and conduct their follow-up observations. This paper introduces TDAC: the first Corpus in Time-Domain Astrophysics, based on observation reports. We also present the NLP experiments we made for named entity recognition based on annotations we made and annotations from the WIESP NLP Challenge.",
